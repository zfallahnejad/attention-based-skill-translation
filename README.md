# attention-based-skill-translation

For training our ASTM models, follow all the steps in this [README](astm/README.md) file. 
After training your model and getting skill translations, you can use [evaluation](astm/evaluate) project to evaluate your translations for the task of expert finding.
You can find examples of running these evaluations in this java project.
